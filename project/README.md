# GMP Cleaning Sample Summary Generator
#### Video Demo: URL Here Eventually
#### Description:

This program is designed for reading of standardized spreadsheet files
that have been filled in with GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) Cleaning Samples
for my place of work in the pharmaceutical industry. The idea being that due to
this work being GMP, that these summaries often should look the same from set to
set, and thus can be given a rather cookie cutter approach in their construction
which works well with automating the task at large. This also should ideally
limit style deviations from sample to sample in a given set and deviations of style
between sample sets as a whole. It should also limit errors id data transcription
from CDS software into a summary statement as long as the spreadsheet is filled
correctly (although ideally this program has error handling for inappropriate
entries in the standardized sheet).
